# Amazon-sales-data-analysis
In today's data-driven world, analyzing sales data is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions and optimize their strategies. In this project I have used various Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract valuable insights from raw data.

Here's a breakdown of the project :

2. Setting up your development environment with Python, Excel, and the necessary libraries.
3. Do necessary installation for python libraries
4. Loading the raw sales data into Pandas DataFrames for efficient manipulation and analysis.
5. Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
6. Performing descriptive statistics using NumPy to gain insights into the dataset.
7. Visualizing sales trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
8. Conducting correlation analysis to identify relationships between different variables.
9. Generating meaningful reports and visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
